    "description": "As a player I want to shoot at certain coordinates and get an indication whether the shot was a hit or miss, to find and destroy the other side’s ships.\n\nThe system is supposed to make sure that players take turns one after the other. The active player should be able to choose a coordinate on the enemy board, and the program should somehow report if that was a hit or a miss and note this result for both sides.\nShots on the same place twice should normally not be allowed.\n\nAcceptance points (roughly):\n– When firing at A1 for the first time, a message should appear showing hit or miss, and that field should become marked.\n– When the same field is targeted again, the shot should not go through, and the next player should then act.\n– After one shot cycle finishes, the control changes so that only the other player can continue.",

    "description": "As a player I need the game to follow the damage of ships and recognize when everything is destroyed, so that the outcome becomes clear.\n\nThe program should count how many parts of each ship are hit and know when a ship has all of its parts damaged. Then it should tell the player that the ship is sunk.\nWhen all ships of one participant are gone, the system should declare that the other player has won and block any more inputs.\nIt should also allow starting over through something like a New Game option.\n\nAcceptance ideas:\n– When the last healthy square of a ship gets hit, that ship should be indicated as sunk.\n– When the final enemy ship is destroyed, the game should end, show who won, and not allow further shooting.\n– When a finished game is restarted, both boards become empty and hidden again.",

When it is the computer’s turn, it should pick a coordinate not already used and shoot.\nThere could be different difficulties such as Easy (random) and Normal (where the computer shoots near previous hits), but precise behavior can vary.\n\nAcceptance references:\n– When single-player mode starts, the computer’s fleet exists, is valid and hidden.\n– When the computer makes a move, its shot is at a coordinate not previously targeted.\n– In Normal mode, if a shot hits, following shots should usually try neighboring cells until that ship is sunk.",
