    "description": "## ðŸš¢ Implement US-01: Setting ships somewhere on the board\n\n### Overview\nThis merge request implements the ship placement system for the Battleship game as described in issue #1. The implementation provides a complete ship placement system with validation for board boundaries and ship overlap.\n\n### Changes\n\n#### Core Entities Created\n- **Board.java**: 10x10 grid implementation with ship placement and validation\n- **Ship.java**: Ship entity with length, position, and damage tracking\n- **Coordinate.java**: Coordinate system for board positions\n- **Player.java**: Player entity managing board and fleet\n- **ShipType.java**: Enumeration of standard ship types (Carrier:5, Battleship:4, Cruiser:3, Submarine:3, Destroyer:2)\n\n#### Services Implemented\n- **ShipPlacementService.java**: Handles ship placement with comprehensive validation\n- **GameView.java**: CLI interface for displaying boards and placement results\n\n#### Main Application\n- **Main.java**: Entry point demonstrating ship placement with both valid and invalid placements\n\n### Requirements Implemented\n\nâœ… **10x10 Board**: Standard Battleship board size implemented\nâœ… **Standard Ships**: All 5 standard ship types (5,4,3,3,2) implemented\nâœ… **Straight Placement**: Ships can only be placed horizontally or vertically\nâœ… **Boundary Validation**: Prevents ships from being placed outside board\nâœ… **Overlap Prevention**: Prevents ships from overlapping\nâœ… **Hidden Boards**: Each player's board is hidden from opponents\n\n### Acceptance Criteria Validated\n\nâœ… **Boundary Validation**: Ships placed outside board boundaries are rejected with error feedback\nâœ… **Overlap Prevention**: Later ship placements cannot overwrite earlier ones\nâœ… **Ready State**: Board is marked as ready when all ships are placed validly\n\n### Testing\n- Comprehensive unit tests for all core entities\n- Integration tests for ship placement service\n- Test coverage for boundary conditions and edge cases\n- All tests passing in pipeline #9406\n\n### Pipeline Status\nâœ… **Pipeline #9406**: SUCCESS\n- Compile job: âœ… Success\n- Test job: âœ… Success\n- All tests passing\n\n### Technical Details\n- **Architecture**: Layered MVC pattern following project standards\n- **Package Structure**: Organized into model, service, and view packages\n- **Validation**: Comprehensive validation with clear error messages\n- **Error Handling**: Graceful error recovery with user feedback\n\nCloses #1",
