    "description": "## Implementation Summary\n\nThis merge request implements the complete save/load functionality for the Battleship game as specified in issue #5.\n\n### Requirements Implemented\n\n✅ **1) Persist complete match state to file**\n- `SaveLoadService` handles serialization of all game state\n- Saves board size, fleet layouts, shot history, sunk statuses, current turn, and game state\n- Hidden information remains concealed from opponent after load\n\n✅ **2) Load and restore exact game state**\n- `GameSaveService` restores complete game state from files\n- Preserves shot history, visible cell states, sunk indicators, current turn\n- Maintains game difficulty/mode and timer value\n\n✅ **3) Validate file and version**\n- `isValidSaveFile()` method validates file integrity\n- Handles missing/invalid/corrupted/incompatible files\n- Reports errors without modifying current game state\n\n✅ **4) Ensure idempotent round-trip**\n- Save immediately followed by load preserves all observable state\n- Comprehensive tests validate round-trip consistency\n- No state changes during save/load cycle\n\n✅ **5) User file selection**\n- Service methods accept file path parameters\n- Controller layer handles user file selection\n- Flexible file location and naming\n\n### Acceptance Criteria Validated\n\n✅ **AC1**: Given a mid-game state S, when the user saves and immediately loads that file, then the restored game equals S in all observable aspects\n- Tested in `testAcceptanceCriterion1_SaveLoadPreservesCompleteState()`\n- Validates shot history, visible states, sunk indicators, current turn\n\n✅ **AC2**: Given a deliberately corrupted or incompatible file, when the user attempts to load it, then an error is shown and the current game remains unchanged\n- Tested in `testAcceptanceCriterion2_CorruptedFileHandling()`\n- Validates error handling and state preservation\n\n✅ **AC3**: Given a finished game (win or loss), when it is saved and later loaded, then the game remains finished with the same outcome\n- Tested in `testAcceptanceCriterion3_FinishedGamePreservation()`\n- Validates finished state preservation\n\n### Technical Implementation\n\n**Core Classes:**\n- `SaveLoadService`: Main service for save/load operations\n- `GameSaveService`: Enhanced service with validation and testing\n- `GameSaveData`: Serializable data structure for game state\n- `PlayerSaveData`: Serializable data structure for player state\n- `ShipSaveData`: Serializable data structure for ship state\n\n**Key Features:**\n- Java serialization for efficient state persistence\n- Comprehensive error handling for file operations\n- Complete state preservation including shot history\n- Validation of save file integrity\n- Round-trip consistency guarantees\n\n**Test Coverage:**\n- Unit tests for individual service methods\n- Integration tests for complete save/load workflow\n- Acceptance criteria validation tests\n- Edge case handling (corrupted files, finished games)\n\nCloses #5",
