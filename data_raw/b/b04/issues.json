    "description": "As someone playing, I would like to somehow arrange the ships on a kind of board that is not visible to the other player, so that the game can fairly begin.\n\nThe system should make available a board of about 10 by 10 fields for every participant, containing the usual ships — one large (5), one slightly smaller (4), and others (3, 3, 2 length).\nIt should somehow allow to put ships straight, not diagonal, and avoid situations where ships overlap or leave the board.\nEach side’s positions should not be seen by the opponent, although the system may manage visibility automatically.\n\nAcceptance expectations (in general terms):\n– If a ship is placed outside the board, the action should not succeed and an error or similar feedback should appear.\n– If two ships end up on the same squares, the later placement should not overwrite the earlier one.\n– When all ships have been placed validly, the board can be considered ready and hidden for the opponent.",

The active player should be able to choose a coordinate on the enemy board, and the program should somehow report if that was a hit or a miss and note this result for both sides.\nShots on the same place twice should normally not be allowed.\n\nAcceptance points (roughly):\n– When firing at A1 for the first time, a message should appear showing hit or miss, and that field should become marked.\n– When the same field is targeted again, the shot should not go through, and the next player should then act.\n– After one shot cycle finishes, the control changes so that only the other player can continue.",

When it is the computer’s turn, it should pick a coordinate not already used and shoot.\nThere could be different difficulties such as Easy (random) and Normal (where the computer shoots near previous hits), but precise behavior can vary.\n\nAcceptance references:\n– When single-player mode starts, the computer’s fleet exists, is valid and hidden.\n– When the computer makes a move, its shot is at a coordinate not previously targeted.\n– In Normal mode, if a shot hits, following shots should usually try neighboring cells until that ship is sunk.",
